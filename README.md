# CompProgAssignPH1 +2
All the code for my ACO102 Project im struggling with
The files supplied *should* read in earthquakeSampleCSV.txt (only when its in the users's downloads folder), sort it by magnitude of earthquake in decending order, and spit out two files, the sortedEarthquake.txt and the invalidInputs.txt back into the users downloads folder
All included code is Phase 1 which works perfectly fine, I am struggling with phase 2(See the PDF of what my professor wants)
Please reach out to me via discord if you have any advice or code that can help with what he wants.
